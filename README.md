# ðŸ”¥Eldr: Physically Based Renderer
## Introduction
_Eldr_ ("fire" in Old Norse) is my new hobby project. After working with
[_Mitsuba 2_](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2) in my master's
thesis [project](https://github.com/nwjnilsson/PPG-quadtree-reconstruction),
I was inspired to create something similar on my own to learn more about
computer graphics. In contrast to Mitsuba, I intend to make Eldr more GUI
oriented, making it possible to set up scenes as you go, and provide more
immediate visual feedback like most commercial renderers do. However, I want to
keep the "research spirit" of Mitsuba, making it as modular as I can to allow
swapping out components and trying new rendering techniques.

I will try to keep cross platform compatibility in mind while developing Eldr,
but it is not a priority in the beginning. I will be developing on Linux and the
build instructions etc. will therefore be Linux(debian)-oriented to begin with.

## Current status
Eldr is in early stage development and I am still working on the Vulkan backend.
I knew Vulkan would be overkill for a project like this but I want to learn it
so it will take the time it takes. I am nearly done refactoring the Vulkan code
and integrating ImGui. After that I need to write some shaders and work on the
scene representation and then I can start path tracing (probably).

## Requirements
A possibly out-of-date list of required software:
```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential ninja-build meson pkg-config python3 \
    python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel libvulkan-dev xcb libxcb-xkb-dev \
    wayland-protocols
```
Meson provides additional dependencies such as libpng, glfw etc.

For debugging:
```
sudo apt-get install vulkan-validationlayers-dev spirv-tools
```

Some other notes:
- For initial testing, I've been using the [Viking room](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/viking-room-a49f1b8e4f5c4ecf9e1fe7d81915ad38)
model by [nigelgoh](https://sketchfab.com/nigelgoh) ([CC BY 4.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20200428202538/https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/viking-room-a49f1b8e4f5c4ecf9e1fe7d81915ad38))
At the moment of writing, there are still hardcoded references to these files,
and they will probably stay until I'm more finished with the vulkan backend.
The files can also be downloaded from the the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Loading_models).

## Build
### App
```
$ meson setup build
$ cd build
$ ninja
```
### Shaders
I have been using [glslc](https://github.com/google/shaderc) to compile some
basic shaders. Eldr will look for the in `assets/shaders/`.
```
glslc src/shaders/main.vert -o assets/shaders/main.vert.spv
glslc src/shaders/main.frag -o assets/shaders/main.frag.spv
```
