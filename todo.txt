When loading multiple gltfs into a scene, additional vulkan scene resources need
to be appended, i.e descriptor allocators need to be resized and new buffers are
needed. Also need to deal with gltf sampler indices appropriately, as the indices
refer to samplers within the gltf itself, but they will be offset by the samplers
already loaded, and if an idendical sampler is already loaded, that should be used
instead.

Make all wrapper objects into vkdeviceobjects. Get rid of some namespaces,
"eldr" is pretty much enough.
